Tools I used throughout the semester

For the HW assignments

**Google docs**

Where/How was it used

Very useful for helping me write up some reports that I needed to submit
for the assignments.

Pros

1)Big help that its very flexible (can use it on mobile and desktop
easily).

2)I don\'t need to worry about not saving my work since most is
autosaved while you are online.

Cons

To fully use it as the devs intended you have to be online. There are
some rare occasions that I don\'t have access to the internet.

**Google slides**

Where/How was it used

Helped me for me organize my presentation and helped me present the
topic I wanted to get across to the audience.

Pros

Easy to use with lots of fonts and designs to use

Free

Cons

Same as google docs to fully use it as the devs intended you have to be
online.

**Microsoft visual studio**

Used this for one of my assignments (Hw 3)

Pros

Very versatile tool which can do a lot of things

Nice UI compared to other similar tools

Lots of resources on how to use it can for the most part google a
problem I have.

Cons

Due to being very versatile it takes a while to know how to use it
properly

Sqlite

Used to make a database/table for the data I had

Pros

lightweight program which does not use a lot of resources

Easy to find commands and how to use them

Cons

Due to having to use it in the terminal the UI was not the best and can
get hard to read sometimes

**Apache**

None I really did not like using this program

jquery which lets you do a lot of common tasks much more easily
